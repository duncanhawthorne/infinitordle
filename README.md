How to play
-----------

* infintitordle features four boards each with a secret five-letter word to guess. 
* Try guessing the word: a green card means you have a letter in the right place, a yellow card means you have a matching letter but in the wrong place. 
* You have a life for each row of cards. 
* Be sure to match the words before you run out of lives. 
#  
* When you get a word right for a board, all five cards will turn green.   
* As a reward, the cards will then slide up, and give you a new row of cards, giving you back a life.   
* The secret word for that board will change to a new secret word, and the cards on that board will change colors to help you find the new secret board.  
#  
* If you get three words right in a row, the cards will start sliding back two rows at a time, giving you back two lives, and giving you the chance to clear the board.
