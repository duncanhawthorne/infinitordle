How to play
-----------

* infinitordle features four boards each with a secret five-letter word to guess. 
* Try guessing the word: a green card means you have a letter in the right place, a yellow card means you have a matching letter but in the wrong place. 
* You have one life for each row of cards. 
* Be sure to match the words before you run out of lives.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
* When you find the word and solve the board, all five cards will turn green.   
* As a reward, the cards will then slide up, and give you a new row of cards, giving you back a life.   
* The secret word for that board will change to a new secret word, and the cards on that board will change colors to help you find the new secret word.
* Continue solving each board, and be careful to use your lives wisely.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;
* If you get solve three boards in sequence, you are on a winning streak.
* On a streak, the cards will slide back two rows at a time, giving you back two lives, and giving you the chance to clear the board.
* Time your streaks carefully for maximum impact.
